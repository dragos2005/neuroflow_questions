Question 2 answers are in the question2 notebook.

Discussion:

Many patients have a GAD-7 score of 0 or 1.  Patients seem to have a slightly higher GAD-7 score on average right after taking their first assessment compared to many months later.  This is true especially among patients who have taken 10 or more assessments.  This could be a sign of patients' score improving over time.  Other important pieces of data that might be useful to collect are demographic data and results for other types of tests for each patient.
